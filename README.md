# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This project is divided into two main sections: the server and the client.

## Server (Strapi CMS)
The server section of my portfolio website is built using Strapi, a headless CMS (Content Management System). Strapi allows me to manage content, such as blog posts, projects, and other dynamic data. To set up the server:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory.
3. Install dependencies by running:
npm install

4. Start the Strapi server:
npm run develop

## Client (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL)
The client section is a React application that showcases my projects, skills, and other relevant information. Here's how to run the client:

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the development server:
npm start

Feel free to customize the content, styles, and layout to make it uniquely yours! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding! ðŸš€
